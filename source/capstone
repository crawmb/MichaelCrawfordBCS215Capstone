1a. My program is a patient directory that has many functions such as adding patients, deleting patients
searching up patients by their last name, and compiling all of the added patients onto a file that stored 
the information in which you were able to look up, add to, and delete from.
1b. One issue with my program is that it makes a patient ID but only with the first letter of the patients last name and counter 
is activated for patients with last names starting with the same letter and not the same name.
